# heart-disease-detection

Project Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. By utilizing the most effective supervised learning algorithms, the project provides a comparative analysis of their performance to identify the most suitable model for accurate heart disease prediction.

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project examines various machine learning algorithms to detect heart disease using clinical and demographic data.

The following top 10 supervised learning algorithms have been implemented in this project:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
AdaBoost
Extra Trees Classifier

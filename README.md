#Heart Disease Detection 

Heart Disease Detection Project Overview 
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease and provides a comparative analysis of different supervised learning models for accuracy and suitability.


🔍 Algorithms Implemented
The project evaluates the following 10 supervised learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
AdaBoost
Extra Trees Classifier
